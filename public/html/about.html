<h3>About</h3>

<p>
  The Object Oriented Journal aims to explore an alternative way of journaling.
  Journal entries are structured in a way similar to objects in object-oriented
  programming, where each entry has a category (class), and sub-categories (attributes).
  The idea is to give more structure to the act of journaling. This project is
  really an experiment to see if there is any value in this approach or not.
  There are three main features in this journaling app that are not found in traditional
  journals.

<h3>Features</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Use of easily searchable category names</b>
    <p>Each entry must have a category name. These names will be remembered by the
      app, which will enable the user the remember common themes in their journaling
      experience, as well as more easily keep track of similiar thoughts and experiences.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Use of user defined sub-categories</b>
    <p>
      Each category has nested within it sub-categories. These are user-defined,
      and can be changed easily when needed, or vary from entry to entry. The journal
      remembers the sub-categories which have already been defined for a given category,
      which enables a user to keep a consistent structure across journal entries from
      the same category.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Easy querying</b>
    <p>
      The journal supports querying of entries by category, sub-category, or text search.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>

<p>
  Journaling has long been viewed as a powerful tool for developing self-awareness,
  and as a tool for getting a look at one's self over a period of time. One difficulty
  in doing this, however, is that it is difficult to remember what you have written in
  the past without explicitly flipping back through all of the pages. This journaling app
  address this issue by having an autocomplete feature which reminds you of entry
  categories you have used in the past, as well as displaying for you recent entries
  from the same category as you write.
